<br/>


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Jira</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop</b>
- <b>Client Support</b>
- <b>Kanban Organization</b>

<h2>Objectives:</h2>

<b>Understand Jira Service Management</b>
- Jira is a powerful and versatile application, and today, we want to understand and focus on features regarding IT management 

<b>Establish Ticket Life Style</b>
- Following a ticket from the beginning, as an open request to its conclusion as a resolved issue
 
<b>Evaluate Best Practices and Key Features</b>
- Honing in on features that optimize It operations such as automated alerts, ticket prioritzation, and email-ticket conversion 


<h2>Configuration Steps:</h2>

__1. Ticket Creation__ <br/>
<br/>
a. Clients have the option to submit tickets with either through a portal, email address, or real-time chats. Tickets submitted through all three channels are collected in one queue for ease of use: <br/>

<br/> 
<br/>
b. Requests can be submitted by category such as "Common Requests" or more specific hardware or application issues. <br/>

<br /> 
Once an option is selected, the user can elaborate and provide information on their issue:

<br />  
<br />
__2. Responding to Tickets__ <br/>
<br/>
a. Submitted tickets appear in a queue. The queue contains helpful information such as request type, the reporter, summary, time created, and status. 'Open' indicates tickets that are ready for work while 'Waiting for Support' tickets need a response from the IT team.: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/henrykim-projects/jira_ticketmanagement/blob/9f40d4fe26704066f4697824795eda5001725df0/images/jira_6.PNG" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/> 
<br/>
b. The status of the ticket can be further changed. For example, they can be elevated to a higher tier for further support, cancelled when the user no longer needs support, and resolved for when the issue is done: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/henrykim-projects/jira_ticketmanagement/blob/02921ef59197addbe046df564ca11e07da68fc4c/images/jira_14.PNG" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/> 
When the IT staff decides to assign themselves a ticket, the issue's urgency and impact are indicated, lending themselves to triage and risk management for issues that affect a higher volume of devices or severity:

<br/> 
<br/>
c. With the ticket assigned, the IT analyst responds to the requester to gather more information or help them with a solution, while exercising excellent customer service:<br/>

<br/> 
<br/>
d. When the issue is successfully resolved, IT support can mark it done- additional documentation such as linked issues can be shared internally to avoid similar blockers in the future: <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/henrykim-projects/jira_ticketmanagement/blob/e7729dd9f15b0c4675654603a3bbf16869b7b023/images/jira_10.PNG" height="50%" width="50%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
<br/> 
<br/>
__3. Additional Key Features__ <br/>
<br/>
a. Jira holds certain features that help with process optimization- one such feature is the "Rules" feature that functions similar to software code, where certain actions are taken depending if specific conditions are met. For example, if a ticket is marked "Elevated" then an automatic email reaching out to the apporpriate tier analyst will be sent automatically, without having to manually contact them. This way, the analyst can seamlessly respond to other tickets: <br/>

<br/> 
<br/>
b. Jira offers an alternate look for the ticket queue as a Kanban board. A Kanban board helps teams visualize tasks and assist with project management. It is frequently implemented for agile softaware projects, and especially useful for IT ticket management: <br/>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
In this project, we followed the life cycle of issue tickets and how IT support respond to and resolve them. We also observed how Jira Service Management optimizes IT operations with client portals, request categorizations, and linked issues documentation, as well as highlighted key features such as automated alerts and Kanban boards to assist teams with task management. In conclusion, IT teams can utilize Jira and its corresponding agile features to fix issues and enhance client satisfaction.
